Pochinki's Engine

We are a pair of students who are working on a 3d Game Engine c++ based.
We are using ImGui library, DevIL,OpenGl,mmgr, Assimp, Glew and MathGeoLib.

**
We started the engine in another repository, but due to some problems we had to change to this one.
Our last repository was https://github.com/JaviOrtiz/Game-Engines
